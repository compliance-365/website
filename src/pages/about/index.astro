        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded by seasoned compliance and security professionals, Compliance365 was built on the belief
          that organisations shouldn‚Äôt have to buy more tools to meet compliance obligations. 
          Instead, we <strong>leverage the platforms you already use ‚Äî Microsoft 365, Azure, AWS ‚Äî</strong>
          and embed compliance directly into your daily workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach is practical, scalable, and tailored to the industries where trust and assurance matter most.
          From <strong>ISO 27001 and SOC 2</strong>, to <strong>ISO 27701 privacy</strong> and the new 
          <strong>ISO 42001 AI governance</strong>, we‚Äôve supported organisations across healthcare, government,
          and technology in proving ‚Äî and improving ‚Äî their security posture.
