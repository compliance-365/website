ISO 27701 extends your ISO 27001 ISMS into a **Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)**.  
Here’s a pragmatic way to stand one up quickly without drowning in templates.

## 1) Anchor your PIMS to business reality
Start with **processing activities** (not controls). Build a lightweight ROPA with:
- Purpose of processing
- Data categories (PII, sensitive)
- Legal basis (consent, contract, legitimate interests)
- Retention + location
- Processors/sub-processors

> Tip: If you already catalogue apps in M365, add a “Privacy” tab and keep the ROPA there.

## 2) DPIAs where risk is real
Run **Data Protection Impact Assessments** on high-risk processes: large-scale monitoring, sensitive data, AI/ML scoring, cross-border transfers.  
Keep it short: context → risks → controls → residual risk → sign-off.

## 3) Map privacy controls to what you already have
Don’t reinvent. Reuse your ISO 27001 controls and add privacy specifics:
- **Access**: role-based, least privilege, periodic reviews (Entra ID reports).
- **Data minimisation**: collection & retention rules (Purview labels/retention).
- **Subject rights**: documented workflow for access/erasure/correction.
- **Third parties**: standard SCCs / DPAs tracked per vendor.

## 4) Evidence lives in Microsoft 365
Automate what you can:
- **Purview**: label policies, DLP reports, retention policies — export monthly.
- **SharePoint**: PIMS policies, ROPA, DPIAs, SR logs — versioned with approvals.
- **Power Automate**: monthly snapshots for auditors.

## 5) What auditors look for
- ROPA is complete and maintained
- DPIAs for high-risk processing
- Subject rights requests are tracked to closure
- Processor oversight (DPAs, SCCs, reviews)
- Policy + practice alignment (retention, minimisation)

**Bottom line:** ISO 27701 is easiest when it’s an **overlay** on your ISMS, not a parallel universe.
