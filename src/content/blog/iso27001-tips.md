Getting started with ISO 27001 doesn’t have to be overwhelming.  
Most organisations stall because they overcomplicate things too early.  
Here are five actions that provide the fastest path to showing tangible progress:

---

### 1. Define your ISMS scope clearly
Decide exactly **what is in and out of scope** — locations, products, services, and people.  
A well-defined scope prevents endless debates later and gives your certifying body confidence that your ISMS is structured.

---

### 2. Choose a risk methodology that works
Don’t overengineer. A simple **likelihood × impact matrix** is often enough at the start.  
The important thing is that you use it consistently and align it to your organisation’s risk appetite.

---

### 3. Draft a simple risk register
Capture your **top 5 security risks** today — no need for a 50-line spreadsheet yet.  
Show ownership, likelihood, impact, and current treatment. This becomes your living document and evidence that risk management is active.

---

### 4. Map current controls to Annex A
List what you already have (policies, firewalls, backups, training, etc.) and map them to Annex A controls.  
This highlights quick wins and obvious gaps without reinventing the wheel.

---

### 5. Book your first internal audit
Even if it’s informal, an internal audit creates a **feedback loop**.  
You’ll spot issues early, learn the audit style, and build confidence before the real certification audit.

---

## Why these matter
Each of these steps gives you **evidence** that auditors and management want to see.  
Together they form the backbone of your ISMS and accelerate your journey to certification.

> **Pro tip:** Don’t wait for perfection. Start small, document as you go, and iterate.  
That’s the ISO 27001 way.
