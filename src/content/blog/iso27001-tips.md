Getting started with ISO 27001 doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Here are 5 actions that provide the fastest path to showing tangible progress:

1. Define your ISMS scope clearly (locations, products, people).
2. Choose a risk methodology that works for your org.
3. Draft a simple risk register with your top 5 risks.
4. Map your current controls to Annex A.
5. Book your first internal audit — even if informal.

Each of these will give you **evidence** to show momentum, and set you up for certification faster.
